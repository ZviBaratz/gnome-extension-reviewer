description: Perform a manual EGO code review of a GNOME Shell extension
---

Perform a manual code review simulating what an EGO (extensions.gnome.org) reviewer checks.

## Target

Extension directory: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, use the current working directory).

## Instructions

Read and follow the full review process defined in this plugin's `skills/ego-review/SKILL.md`. It defines a multi-phase review (Phase 0 through Phase 5a) with checklists in `skills/ego-review/references/`.

Start with Phase 0 (run ego-lint for automated baseline), then proceed through each phase sequentially.
