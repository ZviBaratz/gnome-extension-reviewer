Regression fixture for AI slop rejection case.

Based on the hara-hachi-bu@ZviBaratz extension, which was rejected
from extensions.gnome.org for AI-generated code signals.

Key signals reproduced:
- JSDoc @param/@returns annotations (R-SLOP-01, R-SLOP-02)
- Verbose template error message (R-SLOP-19)
- Catch-log-rethrow pattern (R-SLOP-22)
- LLM prompt comments (R-SLOP-18)
